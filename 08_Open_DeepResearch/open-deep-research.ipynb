        "1. Parallel researchers\n",
        "When the supervisor calls ConductResearch multiple times, several researchers run in parallel via asyncio.gather. Each invocation has its own ResearcherState. With a single shared state, all researchers would read and write the same fields (messages, notes, etc.) and overwrite each other’s work.\n",
        "2. Different lifetimes\n",
        "    a. AgentState: Exists for the whole run (clarify → brief → research → report).\n",
        "    b. SupervisorState: Only during the research phase; it maps to AgentState fields when used as a subgraph.\n",
        "    c. ResearcherState: Short-lived per topic; created for each ConductResearch call, runs to completion, returns ResearcherOutputState, then is discarded.\n",
        "3. Clear input/output boundaries\n",
        "The researcher subgraph is meant to be invoked many times with different topics. It expects ResearcherState and returns ResearcherOutputState. A monolithic state would blur these boundaries and make reuse and composition harder.\n",
        "4. Context and token usage\n",
        "Each level gets only what it needs:\n",
        "    a. Researcher: one topic, not the full supervisor conversation.\n",
        "    b. Supervisor: research brief and iteration info, not each researcher’s raw tool traces.\n",
        "    c. Agent: messages, brief, notes, and final report.\n",
        "That keeps prompts smaller and on-topic and helps control context size.\n",
        "5. Separation of concerns\n",
        "    a. Researcher: Run tools, gather info, compress findings.\n",
        "    b. Supervisor: Decide what to research, delegate, iterate, decide when to stop.\n",
        "    c. Agent: Clarify with user, plan research, orchestrate phases, produce final report.\n",
        "Different roles need different state shapes and lifecycle management.\n",

      "metadata": {},
      "source": [
        "##### Answer:\n",
        "Advantages of importing \n",
        "1. Notebook stays focused\n",
        "The notebook can emphasize flow, architecture, and how pieces connect, without hundreds of lines of state, tools, and graph logic. Easier to read and follow the “story.”\n",
        "2. Reuse and consistency\n",
        "The same state, tools, and nodes are used everywhere. Fixes and improvements happen in one place (open_deep_library/) and apply to any notebook or script that imports them.\n",
        "3. Easier to test\n",
        "Code in modules can be unit-tested (e.g. state.py, utils.py, deep_researcher.py) with normal test runners. Notebooks are harder to test in the same way.\n",
        "4. Version control and diffs\n",
        "Changes to the library show up as clear, small diffs in .py files. Large notebooks with mixed code and output are noisier and harder to review.\n",
        "5. Separation of concerns\n",
        "“What the system does” (library) is separate from “how we run and explore it” (notebook). That separation scales better as the project grows.\n",
        "6. IDE support\n",
        "Go-to-definition, refactors, and type checking work better in .py files than in notebook cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages of importing\n",
        "1. Less visibility for learning\n",
        "To see how state, tools, or the graph are implemented, you have to open state.py, utils.py, deep_researcher.py, etc. The notebook doesn’t show that code by default, so the “full picture” is split across files.\n",
        "2. Context switching\n",
        "Understanding one step (e.g. “what does supervisor do?”) requires jumping to another file instead of scrolling in the same document.\n",
        "3. Setup and packaging\n",
        "The package must be installed or on PYTHONPATH (e.g. pip install -e . or running from the repo root). If that isn’t done, imports fail and the cause is less obvious to someone new.\n",
        "4. Debugging flow\n",
        "Stepping through “notebook → library” with a debugger means crossing from notebook execution into library code. Some people find it easier to debug when everything is in one notebook.\n",
        "5. Copy-paste and sharing\n",
        "A single, self-contained notebook is easier to share (e.g. “run this one file”). With imports, you have to share the whole project or ensure the library is installable.\n",
        "6. Discoverability\n",
        "New learners might not realize they can (and should) open open_deep_library/ to see how things work; the notebook comments help by pointing to files like open_deep_library/state.py and line ranges.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook is using imports and pointing you to the library (e.g. “see open_deep_library/state.py”) so you get:\n",
        "A clean narrative in the notebook, and\n",
        "The real implementation to read and modify in the library.\n",
        "A good way to work is: read the notebook for the high-level flow, then open the referenced module when you want to see or change how something actually works. That combination gives you both clarity and depth.\n"

              "\n",
              "Research consistently shows that controlled breathing techniques can provide immediate stress relief by activating the parasympathetic nervous system. The 4-7-8 breathing technique, developed by Dr. Andrew Weil, involves inhaling for 4 counts, holding for 7, and exhaling for 8. This can be done in as little as 2-3 minutes and has been shown to reduce cortisol levels and anxiety within minutes of practice [1].\n",
              "\n",
              "Box breathing, used by Navy SEALs and validated in multiple studies, involves breathing in for 4 counts, holding for 4, exhaling for 4, and holding empty for 4. This technique can be performed discretely at your desk and provides immediate anxiety relief. Studies published in the International Journal of Yoga demonstrate that even 5 minutes of controlled breathing can significantly reduce work-related stress markers [2].\n",
              "\n",
              "The STOP technique (Stop, Take a breath, Observe, Proceed) is a micro-mindfulness practice that takes 30-60 seconds and can be used multiple times throughout the workday.

A shortened 5-minute version focusing on major muscle groups (shoulders, arms, face, and legs) can be performed at your desk. Clinical studies show PMR reduces muscle tension, lowers blood pressure, and decreases anxiety within one session. The technique involves tensing muscle groups for 5 seconds, then releasing while focusing on the contrast between tension and relaxation [4].\n",

The cognitive restructuring process involves identifying anxious thoughts, examining evidence for and against these thoughts, and developing balanced alternatives. Research published in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology shows that workers who practice cognitive restructuring for just 10 minutes daily experience significant reductions in job anxiety within 2-3 weeks [5].\n",
              "\n",
              "Common cognitive distortions in workplace anxiety include catastrophizing (\"If I make a mistake, I'll be fired\"), all-or-nothing thinking (\"I must be perfect\"), and mind reading (\"My boss thinks I'm incompetent\"). The evidence-based approach involves writing down these thoughts and systematically challenging them with realistic assessments.\n",

Studies show that employees who consistently use this prioritization method report 35% less feeling overwhelmed and improved job performance. The key is spending more time in the \"important but not urgent\" quadrant, which prevents many items from becoming urgent crises [10].\n",
              "\n",
              "Research indicates that weekly and daily planning sessions using priority matrices reduce decision fatigue and the stress associated with constantly reacting to demands.

Research demonstrates that short, intense exercise bursts effectively reduce cortisol levels and improve mood for hours afterward. Simple bodyweight exercises like jumping jacks, squats, and push-ups can be performed in small spaces without equipment [13].\n",
              "\n",
              "Stair climbing for 3-5 minutes has been validated as an effective stress-reduction technique that can be easily incorporated into work environments.

Research shows that consistent practice of mindfulness techniques reduces emotional reactivity and improves mood stability within 4-6 weeks [15].\n",
              "\n",
              "Body scan meditations, even in shortened 5-10 minute versions, have been shown to improve emotional awareness and regulation.
