# Adapted Morning Routine Recommendations

1. **Wake Up Time:** Aim to wake up at 7:00 AM instead of 6:30 AM to allow for more rest.
2. **Hydration:** Start the day with a glass of water.
3. **Gentle Stretching:** 5-10 minutes of light stretching to wake up the body.
4. **Breakfast:** Have a healthy breakfast including protein and fiber (like oats with nuts).
5. **Workout:** If mornings are hard, shift the workout to post-lunch instead of morning workouts.
6. **Mindfulness:** Integrate mindfulness into the evening routine instead of mornings to ease into the day.
