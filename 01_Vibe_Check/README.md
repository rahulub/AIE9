## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE9 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Docs/Prerequisites/Initial_Setup)!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #1: General Vibe Checking Evals

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    - Aspect Tested: Whether the app can answer a technical question
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested: Summarize a text in few words with clarity
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: whether LLM can come up with draft of question asked
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: Can it solve a verbal math problem 
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Aspect Tested: Can the app update the text to communicate in the formal tone 

#### ❓Question #1:

Do the answers appear to be correct and useful?
##### ✅ Answer:
The app was correct and useful when it was asked to do mathematical problem, asked to provide a concise summary of the text. 
The app didn't answe question about Object Oriented programming with technical details, also when it was asked to write it in professional/formal tone, it didn't do a good job. It just framed sentences with few words. It could have done a better job.

#### 🏗️ Activity #2: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Your Assistant Can Answer)

Now test your assistant with personal questions it should be able to help with. Try prompts like:

- "Help me think through the pros and cons of [enter decision you're working on making]."
- "What are the pros and cons of [job A] versus [job B] as the next step in my career?"
- "Draft a polite follow-up [email, text message, chat message] to a [enter person details] who hasn't responded."
- "Help me plan a birthday surprise for [person]."
- "What can I cook with [enter ingredients] in fridge."

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: Help me think through the pros and cons of changing my current job or continue to work in this job where I have already spent 8 years
   - Result: Certainly! Evaluating whether to stay in your current job or pursue a new opportunity is an important decision. Let's break down the pros and cons of each option to help you gain clarity.

### Staying in Your Current Job

4. **Potential for Advancement**: There may still be opportunities for career growth within the company, and you might be in line for promotions or new responsibilities.
5. **Benefits and Retirement**: You might have accrued important benefits like retirement contributions, paid time off, or healthcare that are better than what a new job might offer.

#### Cons:
1. **Stagnation**: After 8 years, there might be a risk of feeling stuck or unchallenged, which can lead to boredom or dissatisfaction.
2. **Limited Career Growth**: If the company has a flat hierarchy, there may be fewer opportunities for advancement or change.
3. **Change Resistance**: Being in the same role for a long time may create a resistance to change, making new opportunities seem intimidating or daunting.
4. **Potential Burnout**: Long-term exposure to the same environment can lead to burnout or feelings of complacency.

### Considering a New Job

#### Pros:
1. **Fresh Challenges**: A new job can provide novel challenges and learning experiences that reignite your passion and motivation.
2. **Career Advancement**: Moving to another company might open doors to higher positions or roles that align better with your career goals.
3. **Expanded Network**: A new workplace provides opportunities to build new professional relationships and expand your network.
4. **Enhanced Skills**: Different roles can help you develop new skills, making you a more versatile professional.
5. **Change of Environment**: A new job can bring a new culture, team dynamics, and potentially a more supportive atmosphere.

#### Cons:
1. **Uncertainty**: Starting fresh can be stressful and unpredictable. It might take time to adapt to a new environment, which can be daunting.
2. **Loss of Established Benefits**: You might lose certain benefits accrued over years at your current job, such as retirement plans or seniority privileges.
3. **Risk of Regret**: If the new job doesn’t work out or isn’t what you hoped for, you might find yourself wishing you stayed in your current position.
4. **Increased Job Search Stress**: The process of finding and interviewing for a new job can be time-consuming and anxiety-inducing.

### Questions to Reflect On:
- What are your long-term career goals? Do you see your current job aligning with those goals?
- How do you feel about your current job overall? Are there aspects you enjoy, and what would you change?
- Have you explored opportunities for growth or changes in your current role that might rekindle your enthusiasm?
- What are the specific motivations driving your desire to change jobs? Are they related to personal growth, financial incentives, work-life balance, or something else?

### Conclusion
Taking time to weigh these pros and cons, along with reflecting on the questions, will help you understand what’s most important to you in your career right now. Whether you choose to stay or move on, ensuring that your decision aligns with your values and aspirations is key.
